# Movie-Review-via-Deep-Learning

This project aims to classify movie reviews as positive or negative, based on the text content of the reviews, via neural networks

The IMDB dataset:

•	The dataset is a set of 50,000 highly polarized reviews from the Internet Movie Database.

•	They are split into 25,000 reviews for training and 25,000 reviews for testing, each set consisting of 50% negative and 50% positive reviews.

•	The IMDB dataset comes packaged with Keras.

•	It has been preprocessed: The reviews (sequences of words) have been turned into sequences of integers, where each integer stands for a specific word in a dictionary.
